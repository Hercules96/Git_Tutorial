# Git_Tutorial
A basic Overview of Git.

What is github?
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers who are collaboratively developing source code during software development.

VCM: Version Control System
SCM: Source Code Management
MVP: First start the software with its important features and then the users feedback we make changes.

EX of VCS: Apache Subversion , mercurial.

Why we need to control our version?
VCS provide a running history of code development and help to resolve conflicts when merging contributions from multiple sources.(Undo and redo is also sort of version control system) Even Google drive also keep a control on the version of the files .We can access any previous file and restore it.

Types of VCM:
1) Centralized :a server acts as the main centralized repository which stores every version of code. Using centralized source control, every user commits directly to the main branch.
2) Distributed :A distributed version control system (DVCS) brings a local copy of the complete repository to every team member's computer, so they can commit, branch, and merge locally.

Advantages of version control system:
1)Keep a control over the versions of the software by maintaining the snapshots.
2)Bug Fixing
3)Doing non linear development
4)Collabrated Development
